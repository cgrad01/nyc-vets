# nyc-vets

This is a submission I made to coding challenge for a developer position.

The prompt asked me to interact with the Github API, get the 10 earliest joined users that list New York (case insensitive) as their location, and output the following in a csv: login, name, location, repo_count.

Repos should be counted starting from a January 1st, 2015, 12:00am UTC creation date.

In order to run this program:

  1. Clone the respository to your desktop.
  2. In your terminal, navigate into the folder titled "nyc-vets"
  3. In the command line, enter "ruby runner.rb"
  4. Follow the instructions.
  5. See your results in the file title "output.csv"

Thanks!
